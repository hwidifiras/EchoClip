# ClipNest Extension - Testing Instructions

## What Was Fixed

The extension wasn't capturing clipboard operations due to several critical issues:

### 1. Missing Offscreen Permission
- **Problem**: Manifest V3 extensions need the `offscreen` permission for reliable clipboard access
- **Fix**: Added `"offscreen"` permission to manifest.json

### 2. Empty Offscreen Document
- **Problem**: The offscreen.html and offscreen.js files were empty, preventing proper clipboard monitoring
- **Fix**: Implemented complete offscreen document with clipboard reading/writing capabilities

### 3. Ineffective Clipboard Monitoring
- **Problem**: The extension only relied on copy events, which miss many clipboard operations
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive monitoring including:
  - Periodic clipboard polling (every 1 second)
  - Multiple event listeners (copy, cut, paste, keyboard shortcuts)
  - Proper duplicate prevention

### 4. Better Integration
- **Problem**: Poor communication between background, content, and offscreen scripts
- **Fix**: Improved message passing and error handling between all components

## How to Test the Extension

### 1. Load the Extension
1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (top right toggle)
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the EchoClip folder
4. The extension should load without errors

### 2. Test Clipboard Capture
1. **Test Text Selection**: 
   - Select any text on a webpage and press Ctrl+C
   - Open the extension popup to see if it was captured

2. **Test External Copying**:
   - Copy text from outside the browser (e.g., Notepad, Word)
   - The extension should detect this within 1-2 seconds

3. **Test Different Content Types**:
   - Copy URLs, emails, code snippets, phone numbers
   - Check if they're properly categorized in the popup

4. **Test Copy from Extension**:
   - Click any item in the extension popup
   - It should copy to clipboard and show a green checkmark

### 3. Check Browser Console
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for ClipNest messages:
   - "ClipNest background script initialized"
   - "Offscreen document created successfully"
   - "Clipboard monitoring started"
   - "Saved clipboard item: [type] [preview]..."

### 4. Debug if Needed
If the extension still doesn't work:

1. **Check Extension Errors**:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Click "Errors" button next to the extension
   - Look for any error messages

2. **Check Console Logs**:
   - Background script logs: Right-click extension → "Inspect views: background page"
   - Content script logs: F12 on any webpage
   - Popup logs: Right-click extension icon → Inspect popup

3. **Permissions Check**:
   - Make sure the extension has all required permissions
   - Try refreshing the extension or reloading it

## Key Improvements Made

1. **Reliable Monitoring**: Uses offscreen document for continuous clipboard monitoring
2. **Multiple Capture Methods**: Combines event listeners with periodic polling
3. **Duplicate Prevention**: Avoids saving the same content multiple times
4. **Better Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when clipboard access is restricted
5. **Improved Performance**: Efficient monitoring with proper resource management

The extension should now capture clipboard operations reliably across all scenarios!
